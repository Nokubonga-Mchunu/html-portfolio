<h1>Nokubonga's Favorite Marvel Movies</h1>
 <h2>My Top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>1. Spider-Man: No Way Home</h3>
 <p>This one in particular is my ultimate top favorite movie because I love All Spider-Man movies. The characters are also relatable to me because we share the same humor in certain scenes. However, simply put, I love it because it was my first childhood superhero movie I loved.</p>

 <h3>2. Iron Man</h3>
 <p>Iron man was the hero we never knew we needed until Avengers: Endgame. The movie is very interesting and has a lot of humour.</p>

 <h3>3. Barbie: Princess Charm School</h3>
 <p>This movie is an all time classic movie of all the Barbie movies for me. It is one of the first movies that taught me the importance of selflessness.</p>
